# get-coolors
A simple Python webcrawler, that grabs color palettes generated by Coolors.co. 

# Why?
The script was designed to feed Processing sketches with auto generated color palettes. I always use [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) (you should probably use it as well), so I decided to create an automatic way of live feeding my sketches with nice colors.

# Instructions
* Keep in mind this was created using Python 3.6.4;
* Install packages listed on requirements.txt (use virtual environments, please);
* Run from command line, using an integer parameter to specify the requests interval in minutes (if no argument is passed, it runs once), and leave it there, doing its job;
* Color palettes will be saved on palettes.txt (as hex codes). IMPORTANT: the script will **prepend** the new color palette to the text file. This way, your Processing sketches may easly seek for fresh, inspiring color palettes, from time to time;
* Please show me what you created using get-coolors.py :).

# Disclaimer
I am no Python expert. I basically put together a bunch of lines of code from the internet, hoping it would work :P. I appreciate feedback and pull requests are flattering.
